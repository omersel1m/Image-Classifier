# Image-Classifier
This project is a deep learning-based image classification application. Built using TensorFlow and Keras, this model categorizes given images into positive or negative classes. The project employs data augmentation techniques on training and validation datasets to enhance the model's generalization capability, and its performance is analyzed through visual graphs.

# Project Features:
Keras and TensorFlow: A convolutional neural network (CNN) model is created and trained for image classification.
Data Augmentation: Various transformations (rotation, zoom, shift, etc.) are applied to the training data to make the model more robust.
Model Performance: Training and validation losses, along with accuracy rates, are visualized through graphs.
Prediction System: The trained model classifies new images, displaying the prediction results on the images.
Batch Testing: A batch validation is performed on images in the test dataset to calculate the model's accuracy.

# Technologies Used:
TensorFlow & Keras
OpenCV
Matplotlib & Seaborn (for plotting)
NumPy

# Results:
At the end of the project, the model can make predictions with high accuracy between the defined classes. Additionally, the model's performance can be monitored throughout the training process, allowing for adjustments as needed.
